## 1. What is Active Directory (AD)?
AD is a directory service developed by [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com/)

**But what is directory service anyway?**

- A directory service is kind of centralized database
- For storing, organizing, and maintaining **information** about users, computers, groups, resources, etc

**Common examples of directory services includes:**
- [X.500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500)
- LDAP-based directories (e.g., [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/))
- Microsoft's Active Directory

**Furthermore:**
- AD manages enterprises-wide data (users, computers, groups, printers) from a central repository
- Data in AD can be globally distributed and accessed selectively as needed
- AD implements LDAP v3 and fully supports LDAP-based queries and authentication
