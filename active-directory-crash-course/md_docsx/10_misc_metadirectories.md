Metadirectories aggregate identity data from multiple, diverse directories into **one unified view** without replacing existing systems.

## Key benefits

- It allows organizations to search and query identity data like it is a single directory
- It reduces complexity of managing multiple directories interfaces
- It also eliminates duplicate identity data across systems
