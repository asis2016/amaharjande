## 1. What is Active Directory (AD)?
- AD is a directory service developed by [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com/)

**But what is directory service anyway?**

- A directory service is kind of centralized database
- For storing and organizing **information** about users, computers, groups, and resources

Common examples of directory services includes:
- [X.500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500)
- LDAP-based directories (e.g., [OpenLDAP]())
- Microsoft's Active Directory

Back to AD:

- Manages enterprises-wide data (users, computers, groups, printers) from a central repository
- Data in AD can be globally distributed and accessed selectively as needed
- AD implements LDAP v3 and fully supports LDAP-based queries and authentication
