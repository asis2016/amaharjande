## 1. What is Active Directory (AD)?
- AD is a directory service developed by Microsoft

**But what is Directory Service anyway?**

- A Directory Service is kind of centralized database
- For storing and organizing **information** about users, computers, groups, and resources


Common examples of Directory Services includes:

- Microsoft's Active Directory
- LDAP-based directories (e.g., OpenLDAP)


Now, back to AD:

- Manages enterprises-wide data (users, computers, groups, printers) from a central repository
- Data in AD can be globally distributed and accessed selectively as needed.
- AD implements LDAP v3 and fully supports LDAP-based queries and authentication.
